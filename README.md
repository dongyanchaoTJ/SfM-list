# List of SfM approaches based on their category<br>

## SfM
### •	Global SfM<br>
The bundle adjustment is usually called once in which all images are optimised at the same time.
•	Global Structure-from-Motion by Similarity Averaging (ICCV 2015)<br>
•	Optimizing the viewing graph for structure-from-motion (CVPR 2015)<br>
•	Robust camera location estimation by convex programming. (CVPR2015)<br>
•	Robust global translations with 1dsfm. (ECCV 2014)<br>
•	A Global Linear Method for Camera Pose Registration (ICCV 2013)<br>
### •	Incremental SfM<br>
The approach repeatedly perform bundle adjustment when new images (typically one image) are added to the existing model.
•	Structure-from-Motion Revisited (CVPR 2016) - COLMAP<br>
•	Towards linear-time incremental structure from motion (3DV 2013) - VisualSFM<br>
•	Building Rome on a cloudless day (ECCV 2010)<br>
•	Photo Tourism - Exploring Photo Collections in 3D (SIGGRAPH 2016) - Bundler<br>
### •	Hierarchical SfM
### •	Hybrid SfM
